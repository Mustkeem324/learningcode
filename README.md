Assignment Title: Full-Stack Developer Challenge

Introduction: You are tasked with building a simple task management application. The application will allow users to create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have a title, description, and a status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). Users should also be able to view a list of tasks and filter them by status.

Front-End Requirements:

User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for the task management application. It should have atleast the following components:

A form to create a new task with fields for title, description, and status.
A list of tasks with the ability to update the status or delete a task.
A filter or dropdown to filter tasks by status (e.g., "All," "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
You can be creative in adding additional features here.

User Experience: Implement smooth and responsive user interactions, including form validation to ensure that tasks cannot be created without a title. Use modern front-end technologies such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.

Styling: Style the application using CSS or a CSS preprocessor (e.g., SASS/SCSS). You can also use a CSS framework if preferred.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
